Poco importaria si te daba
Tu querias todo sin dar nada
En el vacio de la noche
Nuestros palabras vanas

Something different for this
New branch like a new song
That can feel so deep
In the soul of the listener

We lose a couplete and that it
The conflict show his roots
And this is the validation
In the merge will see what happend
